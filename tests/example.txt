Meeting Notes — Product Improvements

The team discussed several enhancements for the next software release.
One idea was to improve search accuracy by integrating a better ranking
mechanism. Another proposal included adding support for document summaries.

The meeting concluded with an agreement to prepare prototypes for both features
and review them during the next sprint planning session.
